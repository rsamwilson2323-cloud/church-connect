## 🌐 ngrok — Public Internet Access

The `ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64` folder contains everything needed for internet access across different networks.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ngrok-v3-stable-windows-amd64.zip` | Full ngrok v3 installer package for Windows |
| `ngrok.exe` | Ready-to-use ngrok executable (no install needed) |

> **ngrok is auto-started by the server** — no manual terminal command needed.
> The public URL is printed automatically in the terminal on startup:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌍 PUBLIC URL — Share with ANYONE, ANYWHERE!     │
│                                                  │
│  👉  https://abc123.ngrok-free.app               │
│                                                  │
│  ✅ This URL works even from other cities!        │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Share this link with anyone — they can join from **Anywhere in the world.**

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Local Network (Same WiFi)

1. Run `node server.js` or double-click `run.bat`
2. Terminal prints your **LAN IP**, e.g. `http://192.168.1.5:4000`
3. Share that URL with anyone on the same network
4. They open it in any browser → enter a name → done ✅

### Internet Access (Different Networks / Cities)

The server auto-starts **ngrok** on launch and prints a public URL — share it with anyone in the world instantly.

## 🖥️ How It Works

```
Device A                  Server (Node.js)               Device B
   │                           │                             │
   │──── join(name) ──────────▶│                             │
   │                           │◀──── join(name) ────────────│
   │                           │                             │
   │──── send file ───────────▶│ (multer saves to uploads/)  │
   │◀─── progress % ───────────│────── file link ───────────▶│
   │                           │                             │
   │──── private msg ─────────▶│──── only to target ────────▶│
   │                           │   (others never receive it) │
```

**Socket.IO** handles all real-time events.
**Multer** streams large files directly to disk — no memory limit.
**ngrok** creates a secure public tunnel for cross-network access.

---

## 🧠 Key Technical Details

| Feature | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Real-time messaging | Socket.IO WebSocket |
| File upload | Multer (disk storage, 50 GB limit) |
| File delivery | Static file server → link in chat |
| Progress tracking | XHR `upload.progress` event |
| Private messages | Socket-ID targeted delivery only |
| Public tunnel | ngrok `@ngrok/ngrok` SDK (auto-start) |
| Max users | Server-enforced at 5 |

---

## 🔒 Private Messaging

When you send a private message or file:
- Only the **selected recipient(s)** receive it
- The **sender** sees it with a 🔒 badge
- **No other user** can see it — not even in chat history
- Private messages are **never stored** in the server history

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Files are accessible **while the server is running**
- When the server stops, file links become inactive (by design — no permanent storage)
- Supports **phones, laptops, tablets** — any modern browser
- All data transfers happen **through your server** as the bridge

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

🔊 Sound alerts for new messages
📊 Transfer speed display (MB/s)
🗂️ File history / download log
🔐 Room password protection
📱 PWA / mobile app version
🧠 AI-based content moderation
📡 Peer-to-peer WebRTC mode
